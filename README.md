# NFT Marketplace

## Project Description
The NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can list, buy, and sell Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This marketplace leverages smart contracts to ensure the safety and transparency of transactions, allowing users to interact with ERC-721 tokens in a seamless and secure manner.

## Project Vision
The vision of the NFT Marketplace is to provide a decentralized and trustless environment for users to trade NFTs, ensuring ownership, transaction security, and transparency. The goal is to create a platform that simplifies NFT trading and ensures fair pricing for digital assets.

## Key Features
- **Listing NFTs**: Users can list their NFTs for sale at a specified price.
- **Purchasing NFTs**: Buyers can purchase listed NFTs by paying the sellerâ€™s set price along with a small listing fee.
- **Listing Fee**: The platform charges a fixed fee for each listing to cover operational costs.
- **Owner Withdrawal**: The marketplace owner can withdraw accumulated funds (including listing fees).
- **Sale Events**: Smart contract emits events for listings and purchases, ensuring transparency.

## Future Scope
- **Auction Mechanism**: Introduce auction functionality where NFTs can be bid on by multiple users.
- **Royalty Support**: Implement support for royalty payments to creators every time their NFTs are resold.
- **Cross-chain Support**: Enable marketplace to support NFTs from multiple blockchain networks.
